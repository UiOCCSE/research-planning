<h2 id="___sec0">Assessing Computational Understanding in Physics </h2>

<p>
<b>Rationale</b>

<ul>
<li> Systematic measurement of student understanding is essential for evaluating movement towards more computational instruction</li>
<li> Partners (i.e., PICUP and faculty collaborators) are grokking for some form of systematic assessment in specific classes</li>
<li> Assessments can help drive further research investigations including comparative and longitudinal studies</li>
<li> The development of these assessments can lead to high visibility of the centre</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="___sec1">Assessing Computational Understanding in Physics </h2>

<p>
<b>Product</b>

<ul>
<li> A suite of assessments of computational understanding in physics that are:</li>

<ul>
  <li> developed for specific courses, yet broadly applicable,</li>
  <li> informed by observed student understanding,</li>
  <li> grounded in faculty-articulated learning goals,</li>
  <li> developed using strong theoretical grounding and methodology, and</li>
  <li> deployed in a centralized way to facilitate community-level research.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec2">Principles of Development </h2>

<ul>
<li> Course-specific</li>
<li> Broad applicability</li>
<li> Informative about student understanding</li>
<li> Informative to and valuable for faculty</li>
<li> Strong theoretical basis for design and measurement</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="___sec3">Principles of Development </h2>

<p>
<b>Course-specific</b>

<ul>
<li> Goals for including computation and thus assessments are tied to specific learning outcomes for courses</li>
<li> Course content is one such aspect, but others include the expectation of more advanced and deeper understandings of the same algorithms and tools</li>
<li> As different courses vary in their depth and focus, overlapping course content should be evaluated (lowest-common denominator assessment)</li>
</ul>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec4">Principles of Development </h2>

<p>
<b>Broad applicability</b>

<ul>
<li> Assessments developed for specific courses should emphasize common content and topics (i.e., overlapping learning goals)</li>
<li> Broader applicability of the assessments will lead to broader use of the assessments</li>
<li> Can support developing a wealth of understanding about implementation and demographic effects</li>
</ul>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec5">Principles of Development </h2>

<p>
<b>Informative about student understandings</b>

<ul>
<li> Assessments should provide information beyond the percentage of students answering correctly</li>
<li> Selected assessment stems should provide information about what understandings students are holding in the moment</li>
<li> Stems should be drawn from expressed understandings of students</li>
<li> Validation of the assessments must include discussion with students</li>
</ul>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec6">Principles of Development </h2>

<p>
<b>Informative to and valuable for faculty</b>

<ul>
<li> As such assessments are meant to inform faculty about changes made to their won courses, these assessment development must involve faculty</li>
<li> Learning outcomes that will be evaluated must be drawn from faculty teaching specific courses</li>
<li> Validation of the assessments must include discussion with faculty</li>
<li> Centralized deployment and analysis can ensure minimal impact on faculty time</li>
</ul>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec7">Principles of Development </h2>

<p>
<b>Theoretical and Methodological Grounding</b>

<ul>
<li> Interviews with students and faculty will explore the variation in understanding and faculty learning goals (Phenomenographic approach)</li>
<li> Continuous validation of items against student understanding and faculty learning goals as assessments are constructed</li>
<li> Assessment design will make use of appropriate measurement theory (Rasch model)</li>
</ul>
