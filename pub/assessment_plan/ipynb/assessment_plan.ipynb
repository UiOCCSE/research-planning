    "\n",
    "**Rationale**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Systematic measurement of student understanding is essential for evaluating movement towards more computational instruction\n",
    "\n",
    "* Partners (i.e., PICUP and faculty collaborators) are grokking for some form of systematic assessment in specific classes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assessments can help drive further research investigations including comparative and longitudinal studies\n",
    "\n",
    "* The development of these assessments can lead to high visibility of the centre\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessing Computational Understanding in Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Product**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A suite of assessments of computational understanding in physics that are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * developed for specific courses, yet broadly applicable,\n",
    "\n",
    "  * informed by observed student understanding,\n",
    "\n",
    "  * grounded in faculty-articulated learning goals,\n",
    "\n",
    "  * developed using strong theoretical grounding and methodology, and\n",
    "\n",
    "  * deployed in a centralized way to facilitate community-level research.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principles of Development\n",
    "\n",
    "* Course-specific\n",
    "\n",
    "* Broad applicability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Informative about student understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "* Informative to and valuable for faculty\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strong theoretical basis for design and measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principles of Development\n",
    "\n",
    "**Course-specific**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Goals for including computation and thus assessments are tied to specific learning outcomes for courses\n",
    "\n",
    "* Course content is one such aspect, but others include the expectation of more advanced and deeper understandings of the same algorithms and tools\n",
    "\n",
    "* As different courses vary in their depth and focus, overlapping course content should be evaluated (lowest-common denominator assessment)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principles of Development\n",
    "\n",
    "**Broad applicability**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assessments developed for specific courses should emphasize common content and topics (i.e., overlapping learning goals)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Broader applicability of the assessments will lead to broader use of the assessments\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can support developing a wealth of understanding about implementation and demographic effects\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principles of Development\n",
    "\n",
    "**Informative about student understandings**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assessments should provide information beyond the percentage of students answering correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "* Selected assessment stems should provide information about what understandings students are holding in the moment\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stems should be drawn from expressed understandings of students\n",
    "\n",
    "* Validation of the assessments must include discussion with students\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principles of Development\n",
    "\n",
    "**Informative to and valuable for faculty**\n",
    "\n",
    "* As such assessments are meant to inform faculty about changes made to their won courses, these assessment development must involve faculty\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learning outcomes that will be evaluated must be drawn from faculty teaching specific courses\n",
    "\n",
    "* Validation of the assessments must include discussion with faculty\n",
    "\n",
    "* Centralized deployment and analysis can ensure minimal impact on faculty time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principles of Development\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theoretical and Methodological Grounding**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interviews with students and faculty will explore the variation in understanding and faculty learning goals (Phenomenographic approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Continuous validation of items against student understanding and faculty learning goals as assessments are constructed\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assessment design will make use of appropriate measurement theory (Rasch model)"
